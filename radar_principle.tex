\chapter{Radar system overview}


In order to build a model capable of accurately capturing key features from various areas one must first understand the origin of the received signal. In this chapter a few fundamental concepts in radar systems are introduced considered critical for understanding the radar responses produced in the measurement setup outlined in the previous chapter. First, the basic principles of radar is explained. The manner in which electromagnetic waves disperse and scatter in a space are briefly discussed. Then, some important features in an actual radar system are considerd. These involve how the radar transmits its wavelets, the mixing process of returning waves and the demodulation procedure used for accurate phase tracking. 

\section{The radar principle}

\subsection{Fundamental concepts}

The radar principle is at its core simple. A radar operates by radiating electromagnetic energy and detecting the echo returned from reflecting targets in its field of view\citep{skolnik_2009}. By examining properties of the echo signal it is possible to obtain information about the targets is provided. This may involve the range at which scatterers are located, the angular at which targets are found or the speed at which a scatterer moves. With a sufficiently high angular and range resolution it is also possible to discern parts of the targets size and shape. 

Radars are active systems, meaning that it radiates using its own antenna and does not depend on ambient radiation. 

\citep{skolnik_2009}


A wavelet pulse $x_T(t)$ with some carrier frequency $\Omega$  is transmitted towards an object of interest. After some short time $t_1$, the radar listens for an echo. If no echo is received, it means there is no object present at distance\footnote{The reason for dividing by 2 is that the wavelet pulse must first travel from the radar to the object, and then find its way back to the radar.}
\begin{equation}
	d_1 = \frac{v_0\cdot t_1}2
\end{equation}
where $v_0$ is the speed of an electromagnetic wave in air. After the previously transmitted wavelet is guaranteed to have died out, a new one is transmitted. Again, the radar listens for an echo, but this time after another time $t_2$ has passed. $t_2$ is greater than $t_1$, meaning the radar listens for echoes further away. If an echo is received, it means there is an object present at distance 
$
	d_2 = \frac12(v_0\cdot t_2).
$
This process is repeated for different time delays $t_i$. The chosen time delays can be adjusted depending on in what ranges one wants to search in, and how good range resolution one seeks.

Together, the echoes (or lack thereof) from each transmitted wavelet make up one sweep. A sweep is often plotted in an amplitude-vs-range, or -depth diagram as in figure \ref{fig:single_sweep}. This plot is a good way to visualize at what ranges objects are present.

\subsection{Radar wave dispersion}

How signals get weaker by a factor 1/r4


1-dimensional data: signals propagate in a spherical manner

How this ties in to what we do


If it is assumed that the radar pulses are transmitted isotropically, and no power is lost in the transmission medium, the power density at a range $R$ is the emission power $P_t$ divided by the surface area of a sphere with radius $R$.

The ratio $R$ between the transmitted signal power nd the received signal power is described in the \emph{Radar Transmission Equation}, seen below. Relating the 

In this report a singular radar transmitter and receiver is used.

\section{Radar operation}

A pulsed radar system can be realized in countless ways, but all subscribe to the fundamental physical laws of electromagnetic radiation. In this section one such configuration is described. Furthermore, we describe the key signal processing method, \emph{In-phase and Quadrature-phase demodulation} (IQ demodulation), used for extracting useful information from the unprocessed radar response. 

\subsection{Elements of a pulsed radar}
The radar system considered in this report includes the following crucial components:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Waveform generator
	\item Oscillator
	\item Transmitting antenna
	\item Receiving antenna
	\item Mixer
	\item Integrator
\end{itemize}

A waveform generator outputs a radar envelope which is modulated by a local oscillator to some desired radio frequency. After signal amplification the wavelet is transmitted through an antenna. Detection is performed by a second antenna, which receives the returning signal during some time interval. 

\subsection{Mixing}

After receiving the returning radiation the signal then goes through a process known as \emph{mixing}. An internal wavelet is generated at a very specific delay from the initial pulse transmission and multiplied with the received signal. If the received and internal pulses do not match, the output of this multiplication will be zero. If there however exist some overlap between the internal and returning signals the output will be nonzero, indicating some level of energy content at the distance corresponding to the internal pulse delay. By increasing the internal pulse delay and repeating this procedure a set of measurement points is obtained. Mixing is thus achieved by multiplying a large number of returning wavelets with internally generated wavelet counterparts, adding a slight delay between sampling points. 

% Describe why this process is equivalent to an autocorrelation
% Include plot of raw data to show what a real sweep looks like.

Figures \ref{fig:mix0}, \ref{fig:mix1} and \ref{fig:mix2} illustrate this principle. In the upper plot in the first two figures two analysis wavelets are shown, each at a different time delay. The center plot show the received radar pulse registrered by the antenna, and the lower plot the result when the two above signals are multiplied elementwise. Note that the final figure show the result of multiple received electromagnetic pulses, each sample point representing a summation of one set of multiplications between returning and internally generated signals. This output will henceforth be called the \emph{raw signal}.

\subsection{IQ demodulated data}
A common type of data when working with radar signal processing is in-phase and quadrature-phase data (IQ-data).  This type of data is useful in that it contains information not only about amplitude, but about the phase of the radar signal as well \citep{richards_2014}. IQ-data is represented as complex numbers, and a radar sweep consists of several such complex numbers - one for each investigated range. To obtain the amplitude plot, as the one in figure .... for a sweep, $s$, made up of IQ-data, one simply computes the absolute value for each complex number in $s$. Similarly, a phase curve can be obtained by computing the phase in each point. A phase curve can typically look like the one in *Figure of phase plot*

In many applications, the phase information in IQ-data is used when small changes in the radar signal need to be detected, (Mention a case such as recording over grass...) as the phase is more sensitive to changes than the amplitude \citep{lien_gillian_karagozler_amihood_schwesig_olson_raja_poupyrev_2016}. If an object is detected at distance $r(t_1)$ from the radar at time $t_1$, and shortly thereafter, the object is moved to distance $r(t_2)$, the corresponding difference in phase will be
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:phase_diff}
	\Delta\phi(t_1, t_2)=\frac{4\pi}{\lambda}(r(t_2)-r(t_1)) \quad\quad \textrm{mod 2$\pi$}
\end{equation}
By having a sampling frequency which is too low, the range difference in $\eqref{eq:phase_diff}$ could potentially become very big, and the phase difference would fluctuate over time and be incomprehensible.

In the case of material classification, a high sampling frequency is highly beneficial. When moving across surfaces characterized by tiny details, a high sampling frequency is essential in capturing the shape of these.

For a thorough description of how IQ-data is derived from raw radar data, we refer to \citep{richards_2014}

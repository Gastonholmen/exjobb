\chapter{Introduction}


Radars have several highly attractive properties: they are active systems independent on lighting conditions, are very fast and have high precision. Furthermore, implemented at millimeter-wave RF frequencies, a radar sensor can be designed as a low-power device with no moving parts and in a favorable form factor \citep{lien_gillian_karagozler_amihood_schwesig_olson_raja_poupyrev_2016}.

Radar technology has been around since the 1930s \citep{watson-watt_1945}, and has since developed into a well established field of engineering. Although the archetypal use case in RF radars regard detection and tracking of large objects at far distances, such as for air and marine monitoring, new areas of applications have emerged under recent years posing very different engineering challenges. Some of these are outlined in \citep{amin_2017}, where close-range radars are used vital signs monitoring \citep{kuo_lin_yu_lo_lyu_chou_chuang_2016}, gesture recognition \citep{lien_gillian_karagozler_amihood_schwesig_olson_raja_poupyrev_2016} and tumour imaging \citep{klemm_gibbins_leendertz_horseman_preece_benjamin_craddock_2011} to name a few. Furthermore, millimeter-wave radars have lately become more inexpensive, largely due to their widespread adoption in the automotive industry \citep{frenzel_2018}, making such devices an attractive option in a wide range of applications.

Alongside the miniaturization of radar systems a trend in data science has emerged; the movement towards machine learning centric methods. This transition, spanned over multiple decades, has placed machine learning as one of the main-stays of information technology. Machine learning algorithms encompass a very large set of algorithms, but fundamentally utilize various statistical techniques in order to allow computer systems to progressively improve performance \citep{a_smola_svn_vishwanathan_2010}. With ever increasing amounts of data, smart data analysis has proven key for technological progress . Data scientists have found machine learning, which forms a subclass of aritficial intelligence, extremely practical especially for data that lack an easily predictable structure.

In this work we investigate whether millimeter-wave radar can be used for surface recognition. We propose an approach using two non-synchronized 60 GHz radar sensors for surface classification. Two broad antenna beams illuminate a scene capturing a complex refelected signal, and using signal processing and machine learning techniques we classify the surface type. This work focuses on the use case of determining if a surface is grassy or not, but could easily be extended to invoke other surface types as well.  

\section{Motivation and previous work}

Autonomous robots have found increasing use in numerous systems, from helping customers navigate stores \citep{mcsweeney_2018} to keeping floors clean \citep{ifr_press_release_2016} and mowing lawns \citep{udelhofen_2018}. A common challenge with such systems is keeping the robot in bounds. This commonly means for the robot to be aware where on a two-dimensional map it is currently located. In certain applications however, "in bounds" rather involves staying on one type of material, such as autonomous robot lawn mowers staying only on areas covered in grass, or robot vacuum cleaners on regions without a carpet. In such devices one may be content with knowing that the robot roams around remaining on its designated surface type rather than having knowledge of its exact position. 

Surface classification can also be used in autonomous devices as a supporting system. For the example used above, a robot vacuum cleaner could make use of such a system in numerous ways, such as for avoiding liquid spills or using surface-dependant cleaning programs. One could easily imagine other use cases where such a system would be a great convenience. Thus, it would be immensely useful to devise a system able to determine surface type. 

In order to distinguish one surface type from another some feature of the surface at hand must somehow be captured and analyzed. This very general problem statement can and has been approached from many different angles.

Taking inspiration from the recent advances in self-driving cars, one may be tempted to use cameras for visual inspection of the surface at hand. Computer vision has indeed attracted extensive research over the past few decades with impressive results \citep{liu_chen_fieguth_zhao_chellappa_pietikäinen_2018}. In a computer vision framework, images of different surfaces can be separated by their differences in \emph{texture} - their spatial organization of basic elements. Such fundamental microstructures obey some kind of statistical properties which can be percepted by for instance a convolutional neural network. Effective texture identification of textures in image databases was used in, for example, \citep{do_vetterli_2002} for accuracte classification. \\
\indent Although using computer vision for accurate real time target identification is an attractive option, it is commonly an infeasible option for small devices with limited hardware capabilities. Cameras capture light in the visible frequency spectrum, which inherently renders them sensitive to changes in light conditions. Thus, unless direct illumination of the target surface is used, solutions involving cameras are highly dependent on ambient light. Such a limitation can make cameras impractical for small devices navigating areas with varying lighting. \\
\indent The perhaps most immediate way to perform surface identification is through direct contact. In \citep{giguere_dudek_2011}, surface identification for low-velocity mobile robots considered using a small metallic rod with an attached accelerometer. By capturing accelerometer output induced in the tip of the rod during robot motion identification was possible for a couple of different surface types. While probing may produce appealing results in certain situations, the method is fundamentally based on physical contact with the target. Hence, a probe is more susceptible to damage, can more easily get stuck and is more exposed to detrimental tear over time than its non-interfering counterparts. \\
% Two chief methods for doing this - Ultrsonic and radar. 
\indent For surface classification with devices in motion, the seemingly two chief methods researchers have spent their time on for this application are ultrasonic methods and radar-based methods. These two methods are both noninvasive and have modest power requirements. Being active systems, meaning that they do not require any ambient signal source. Ultrasonic and radar systems have been tested by researchers for road condition monitoring \citep{bystrov_2016}, \citep{mckerrow_kristiansen_2006}. \\
\indent These two methods primarily utilize the difference in roughness, a geometric characteristic of a surface caused by spatial variations in surface depth. Researchers experimenting with ultrasonic sensors (perhaps motivated by a study proving bats capable of discriminating surfaces with different roughness with their echolocation \citep{schmidt_1988}) have found some degree of success. In \citep{politis_probert_1999} angled ultrasonic sensors were used to measure roughness. By using the distribution of energy between specular (i.e. miroor-like) and diffuse componenets of ultrasonic echo they were able to distinguish between six different surface types, and modeling the floor as having a random structure on the form of a Gaussian distribution around the surface plane creating. Using this method the researchers were able to generate predictions on a sample-by-sample basis, not taking the temporal dimension into account.
% Work with the last part here - radar applications/radarCat etc. We wish to utilize time-based methods. Would be neat to find radar work doing nearly the same thing

In this work, we to examine temporal domain methods for single-antenna radar for surface classification. By collecting data on grass surfaces and selection of non-grass surfaces we attempt to create an effective classifier able to distinguish a grass covered surface from other surface types. All experiments will be performed using two Acconeer A1 60 Ghz pulsed coherent radar (PCR) sensors, see figure \ref{fig:acc_sens},  mounted on the front of device moving straight at a constant velocity. 

%\subsection{Problem formulation}
%With this work, we intend to present a solution towards surface identification based on radar data. The data is collected using two 60 GHz Acconeer radar sensors, each with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz. Both sensors are mounted at the front of a robot, and are assumed to move across a surface with a constant speed and height.

%Once obtained, the data will undergo feature extraction. Ideally, we want few features that carry as much information as possible. The next step is to develop a machine learning model into which these features will be feeded. Several different model types will be investigated and evaluated, after which we choose one to proceed with and optimize. 

%The working procedure is illustrated in figure (....)

%We develop a pipeline for effectively solving this problem. 
%We present modelling options with high accuracy and efficacy. 
%We present results based on a 60GHz Acconeer micro radar. 
%In this paper we introduce means of surface identification based on the output from a single 60 GHz radar sensor moving across a surface with constant height. 



% We only have one sensor and want to work in the temporal domain. 

%\section{Radar Fundamentals}

%Fundamentally, a radar operates by radiating radio frequency (RF) electromagnetic energy and listening if the transmitted energy generates any echoes \citep{skolnik_2009}. By analyzing properties of the returning signal it is then possible to obtain information about the target objects that scattered the transmitted pulse. This may involve the distance and angle at which scatterers are located or which velocity they are moving in. With a sufficiently high angular and range resolution it is possible to descern parts of the ragets' sizes and shapes.  

%If a perfect scatterer is located a distance $d$ from a radar transmitter, and a radar pulse with envelope $A(t)$ and angular frequency $\Omega$ is transmitted towards it, the returning signal will have the form \citep{richards_2014}

%\begin{equation}
%	r(t) = CA(t)\sin(\Omega t + \theta(t))
%\end{equation}

%where $C$ is some constant related to the dissapation of power throughout space and some radar system properties. % More on this

%In spite of their rise in populatity, solutions for surface classification using high frequency radars are somewhat scarce. When a single radar sensor is used for this purpose and a nonstationary setting is considered such as for a device moving across a surface of interest, very little previous work can be found in litterature. The perhaps closest resemblance is the RadarCat project\citep{yeo_2016}. As a part of Google's project Soli, RadarCat used a radar sensor for material classification. Nonetheless, a central part of this approach was having an object stationary and in direct contact with the radar sensor. The focal point of Project Soli was gesture recognition. This application bears some similarities to surface classification in motion in the regard that the subject is nonstationary. However classifying surfaces during motion and classifying hand gestures differ on a critical point - gestures are actions performed during some window in time while a robot moving along a surface is a continuous operation.

%\subsection{Previous work}


%It is in many applications of interest to obtain images of subsurface identification nondestructively. In recent decades, ground penetrating radar (GPR) has found increasing use in evaluation of road conditions \citep{solla_gonzález-jorge_varela_lorenzo_2013} for preservation and maintenance of infrastructure.


%A major challenge in radar sensing is to not only detect, but also to identify radar targets. This can for example be used for monitoring of urban environments \citep{harter_kowalewski_sit_jalilvand_ziroff_zwick_2014}.

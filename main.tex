\section{Introduction}

In this report a micro radar system is utilized for surface classification. Specifically, a radar sensor is placed on the inside of a robot facing downwards, with the objective of distinguishing if the surface below is made of grass and dirt or not.

\section{Radar system overview}

The radar system used for this project is a 60 GHz radar developed by Acconeer AB.

An antenna transmits a wavelet signal towards an object of interest. After a brief period of time a second wavelet signal is generated and \emph{mixed} with data from a recieving antenna. This procedure is repeated, every time slightly delaying the generation of the second wavelet and thus mixing with a different section of the incoming pulse. 

Throgh this methodology we can effectively produce

\subsection{IQ demodulation}

        Millimeter-wave radars have received increasing attention in consumer electronics. In this report the use of a 60 GHz pulsed coherent radar for surface classification is evaluated for a small device moving at constant velocity. This work is focused on determining if a target surface is a lawn or belonging to a set of 5 other surface types commonly found adjacent to lawns. It is found that a combination of temporal feature extraction and a neural network classifier allows for accurate surface classification wh

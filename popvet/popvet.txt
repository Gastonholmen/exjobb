Imagine you are standing at the top of the Grand Canyon. You reach into your pocket to pull out an old stopwatch you brought. With the watch in your hand, you clear your throat, and at the very same moment that you let the clock start ticking you burst out in a sudden roar. Your surrounding is startled as your voice echoes through the canyons, and just as the echo gets back to you, you stop your watch. From the time on your stopwatch and clever as you are, knowing the speed of sound, you figure out that it must have bounced back from the cliff 451 meters away from you. 

This is the basic principle of a radar – a device that measures at what distances objects are present. Recently, the applications of them have blossomed and today you find them in automatic light switches, in your car and soon perhaps even in your lawnmower.

Starting out as a curious experiment, we discovered that by mounting a small radar on the inside of an automatic lawnmower it is possible to determine what kind of surface the mower is moving across by studying what the radar outputs. This technology could for instance put an end to the long, cumbersome wire you may be familiar with if you own an automatic lawnmower. In addition, the technology could of course be generalized to work on for example indoor surfaces, allowing toys and robot vacuum cleaners to navigate their way through your home. 

With the big hype on machine learning going on, we could not resist attempting to solve the problem using this approach. After having collected over two million radar snapshots from a variety of surfaces we started researching, and quickly realized that only observing one snapshot at a time wasn’t enough for the results we desired. Instead, we used several consecutive snapshots and rather studied how these related to each other over time. Imagine if you closed your eyes, it would be much easier to identify a surface if you dragged your finger along it rather than if you just put it atop.

Radar technology may have existed for a long time. But with recent breakthroughs and the increased use of machine learning, radars have proven to be useful in unexpected areas.

Imagine you are standing at the top of the Grand Canyon. You reach into your pocket to pull out an old stopwatch you brought. With the watch in your hand, you clear your throat, and at the very same moment that you let the clock start ticking you burst out in a sudden roar. Your surrounding is startled as your voice echoes through the canyons, and just as the echo gets back to you, you stop your watch. From the time on your stopwatch and clever as you are, knowing the speed of sound, you figure out that it must have bounced back from the cliff 451 meters away from you. 

This is the basic principle of a radar – a device that measures at what distances objects are present. Recently, the applications of them have blossomed and today you find them in automatic light switches, in your car and soon perhaps even in your lawnmower.

Starting out as a curious experiment, we discovered that by mounting a small radar on the inside of an automatic lawnmower it is possible to determine what kind of surface the mower is moving across by studying what the radar outputs. This technology could for instance put an end to the long, cumbersome wire you may be familiar with if you own an automatic lawnmower. In addition, the technology could of course be generalized to work on for example indoor surfaces, allowing toys and robot vacuum cleaners to navigate their way through your home. 

With the big hype on machine learning going on, it was tempting to approach the problem from this direction. After having collected plenty of radar snapshots from a variety of surfaces we started researching, and quickly realized that only observing one snapshot at a time wasn’t enough for the results we desired. Instead, we used several consecutive snapshots and rather studied how these relate to each other over time. This analysis results in complex data. Of course, by looking at surfaces, it is easy for us to distinguish between all kinds of surfaces. But through a radar's eyes, the surfaces are just numbers, and for us it is extremely hard to come to any conclusions from these.

Imagine dragging your finger across a surface - it is much easier to identify it than if you were to just put your finger on top of it. 

Of course, by looking at the surfaces, they are even easier to distinguish. But through a radar's eyes, they appear as numbers, and for us it is extremely difficult to reach any conclusions by just looking at those. This is where machine learning comes in. One could think of machine learning as a tool for finding patterns that we cannot see. 

Even if it is hard for us to see, the machine learning models reveal that the radar manages to capture surface structures.

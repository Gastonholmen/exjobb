\section{Moisture}

One particularly challenging aspect of adequately classifying surfaces is the ever-changing environmental conditions surronding the sensor. Of particular interest is the moisture content in the surfaces of interest. Greater soil moisture implies higher dielectric constant, which in turn increases radar wave scattering \citep{rappaport_2006}. Thus a single surface may very well change its scattering properties over time. 

% More things that make selecting data tricky

\section{Surface variances}

Such effects is difficult to account for when selecting data. Gather a dataset as diverse as possible

\section{Feature Extraction}
 Machine learning is used to find features it considers are good. By manually performing feat. ext. we remove information that the algorithms may otherwise have used to become even better etc. 
Future work: investigate models with no manual feat. extr.

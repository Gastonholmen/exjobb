\section{Conclusions}

	What was the point of all this?
	
	It is possible
	Slow-time processsing is key
	We found DNN thing to work well
	Median filtering is nice
	New surfaces -> underined behaviour



\section{Future work}

	No feature extraction
	Automatic feature extraction(/selection?)
	More data! And more types of data
	Test for other tasks - such as road condition monitoring
	Implement velocity-dependent sampling rate
	Linear and non-linear models
	Outlier removal

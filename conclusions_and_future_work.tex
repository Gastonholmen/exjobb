\chapter{Conclusions and Future Work}

\section{Conclusions}
In this work, the possibilities of using millimeter-wave radar for surface classification were explored. We found that by manually extracting features exploiting temporal behaviour and combining this with a deep neural network model, we were able to perform binary classification, distinguishing grass-surfaces from other types of surfaces with an accuracy as high as 98.5 \%. Using a median filter, predictions were improved, giving a perect result on test data, as well as a promising result on basic real world applications. When confronted with unfamiliar surfaces, the model falls short, and further investigation in this area is required. 
% Mention that patent application has been submitted. Ask Peter how this ought to be phrased and what to include?


\section{Future work}

	No feature extraction
	Automatic feature extraction(/selection?)
	More data! And more types of data
	Test for other tasks - such as road condition monitoring
	Implement velocity-dependent sampling rate
	Linear and non-linear models
	Outlier removal

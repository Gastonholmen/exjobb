Overall
[X] Carrier frequency fc
[X] Autocov, autocorr
 - Fast time and slow time terminology
 - Make sure we're not reusing variable names
[X] Feature selection -> feature extraction
 - Shorten unnecessarily long parts
 - Capital letters on important title words

Abstract
 - Write when ch8 is done

Pop science article
 - Write when ch8 is done

Ch 1
 - Radar sources for road contition monitoring

Ch 2
 - RCS - explain beter.

Ch 3
[X] Downsampling: start/stop/step etc. Check constatnts on acconeerfs 

Ch 4
[X] Remove sample index
[X] DFT notation
[X] Error in eq. 4.9
 - Connecting Autocovariance to beat frequencies?
 - The feature configs have very high accuracies
[X] Downsampling factor in 4.2.5 after changing in ch 3.

Ch 5
[X] Hyperas - which parameters were optimized? 

Ch 6
 - Data augmentation - Understandable?
 - Detection alg -> outlier suppression method
[X] 6.2 index

Ch 7
 - PCA plot is a concept proof
 - Linear vs. non-linear
 - Surfaces not seen in training -> undefined behaviour
[X] Note that predictions are stable (not seen in LOO table)
[X] Comment on feat extr. vs no feat extr. - loss of info vs. directed classification
 - Balancing of data
[X] Velocity-dependent sampling - speed varied slightly during tests so that spatial sampling is the same. 

Ch 8
[X] Conclusions
 G Future Work

Overall
[X] Carrier frequency fc
[X] Autocov, autocorr
[X] Figure out if any, and if so which, variable names are used in different ways.
 - Change name of x_T to something else - x is already in use.
[X] Fast time and slow time terminology
[X] Make sure we're not reusing variable names
[X] Feature selection -> feature extraction
[X] Shorten unnecessarily long parts
[X] Capital letters in titles
 - Change all equation references to use \eqref instead of both \ref and \eqref
 - Spelling mistakes

Abstract
 - Write when ch8 is done

Pop science article
 - Write when ch8 is done

Ch 1
 - Radar sources for road contition monitoring

Ch 2
[X] RCS - explain beter.

Ch 3
[X] Downsampling: start/stop/step etc. Check constatnts on acconeerfs 

Ch 4
[X] Remove sample index
[X] DFT notation
[X] Error in eq. 4.9
 - Connecting Autocovariance to beat frequencies?
[X] The feature configs have very high accuracies
[X] Downsampling factor in 4.2.5 after changing in ch 3.
[X] We need to mention that T=25.
 - Update text with regards to new SVM config comparison

Ch 5
 - Logistic regression - this is not accurately described. We optimize for b parameters and try to separate two classes from each other. 
 - Neural networks - "too many epochs puts the model at risk of overfitting." Is this true? If so we should include a source. 
 - Leave-One-Out Strategy - we don't explain that we are excluding the larger set of data in training and thus avoid fitting with neighbouring samples. This is well done in the figure but should say in the text too. 
[X] Hyperas - which parameters were optimized? 
[X] Accuracies are now for a linear support vector classifier
 - Write about that it is now an svm classification

Ch 6
[X] Data augmentation - Understandable?
[X] Detection alg -> outlier suppression method
[X] 6.2 index

Ch 7
 - PCA plot is a concept proof
 - Linear vs. non-linear
 - Surfaces not seen in training -> undefined behaviour
[X] Note that predictions are stable (not seen in LOO table)
[X] Comment on feat extr. vs no feat extr. - loss of info vs. directed classification
 - Balancing of data
[X] Velocity-dependent sampling - speed varied slightly during tests so that spatial sampling is the same. 
 - Discuss the CNN+LSTM model
 - The last part in Errors&Uncertainties was commented out as it didn't really belong there. Maybe move it?

Ch 8
[X] Conclusions
[X] Future Work

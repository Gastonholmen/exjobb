	First of all we would like to thank Acconeer for providing us with the opportunity to do our thesis project in collaboration with the company. Furthermore we would like to thank the members of the algorithm team at Acconeer - Peter Almers, Rickard Nelander, Bo Lincoln, Erik MÃ¥nsson and Daniel Jung - for all your insightful discussions as well as your helpful and friendly disposition. A special thanks to our supervisor at Acconeer Peter Almers for his unwavering dediction and input throughout the making of this work, as well as for his infectious enthusiasm. We would also like to thank our supervisor at the university, Andreas Jakobsson, for his guidance in this project. One could not ask for better supervisors and coworkers.
